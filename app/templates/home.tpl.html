		Hello! My name is Cameron and I live in Atlanta. I'm obsessed with technology and even more obsessed with fixing all of my friend's gadgets. I started dabbling in HTML when I was 12 years old. As I grew older, I figured out what CSS was and started changing background colors and font. My skills have sharpened since then and I decided to go to school for front-end development.
		</p><br>

		<p>
		At The Iron Yard Atlanta, we focused primarly on <strong>HTML/CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. We were trained to work in solo and team projects. My time there helped my skills evolve to what they are today.
